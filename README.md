# Introduction

This repository is suposed to be my technical-explanatory registry of all challenges i can write about in a theoretical form.

My intention here is not to reproduce the old structure of other writeups made about the challenge – and I believe there are many – where the text output of the target program in the terminal is quickly presented and the answer is displayed, almost as a given fact of reality. My goal is to make this list of challenges a compilation of explanatory lessons, covering the theory of relevant themes regarding operating systems, networking and programming.
